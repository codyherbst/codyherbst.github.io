                <h2>Week 1 Blog Post</h2>
                <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning bootstrap has been the single most important lesson when it comes to understanding design.
                    I in no way would have been comfortable doing design if only using CSS and html was a thing.
                </p>
                <h3>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to continue to learn how to design for mobile first. It seems to me developing with the screen set to 
                    mobile at the beginning will allow me to focus better on designing a more responsive website.
                </p>
                <h3>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</h3>
                <p>
                    The above answer sort of answers this question. Mobile first seems to be the most important consideration when designing a website for a user.
                    Accessibility seems to be the most important aspect as a user however. If you have to jump through hoops on a website to do something then 
                    that user will likely bounce and not stay.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>
                <p>
                    Without exposing myself too much, Dealing with personal life issues has been the biggest hold up. Everyday is impacted by it but I only look to 
                    persevere, even if I cannot perform to the best of my ability. Doing this interests me more than anything I have done in the past.
                </p>
                <h3>What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    I feel I need to get better at design. It is the one thing so far that I don't feel very confident in nor interested in.
                </p>

                <h2>Prework Week 4 Blog Post</h2>
                <h3>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in prework?</h3>
                <p>
                    One thing I liked through the prework was working with javascript. I am somewhat familiar with python
                    and java so it's nice to see something I'm familiar with. I dislike CSS at this point however as it 
                    is hard to make sense of.
                </p>
                <h3>What was helpful?</h3>
                <p>
                    The most helpful thing for me was using slack. It's nice to be able to both ask and answer questions so 
                    easily.
                </p>
                <h3>What hindered your progress?</h3>
                <p>
                    Work hindered my progress in the beginning. Balancing work with learning is not done easily. Otherwise it was only 
                    personal challenges.
                </p>
                <h3>How did you overcome challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Persevering is the only way I can answer this question. Keeping in mind that this is a better oportunity to meet my personal
                    goals versus other previous career choices is definitely a driving factor.
                </p>

                <h2>Prework Week 3 Blog Post</h2>
                <h3>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and 
                    providing user experience?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it's interesting that JavaScript and CSS can be interchangable in doing certain tasks for a site. JavaScript simply
                    provides a bit more functionality when doing it from what I've been reading. Overall the separation of responsibility between
                    the three languages is a sensible way to do web development.
                </p>
                <h3>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently I don't have any JS being used so I don't think I have an objects incoroporated at the moment.

                <h2>Prework Week 2 Blog Post</h2>
                <h3>What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the time of completing this post I have not finished with the pseudocoding portion of the week. However from previous
                    coding classes/experiences I understand it is invaluable in organizing and thinking of the necessary requirements for a
                    given project.
                </p>
                <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the moment my main struggle is still with css. There's an absurd amount of properties to learn it seems.
                </p>
              <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
                <p>
                    I am mostly excited to begin working with javascript. Although html and css are interesting it doesn't quite fill a problem-solving itch
                    like javascript and other future languages will, or so I hope! 
                </p>

            <h2>Prework Week 1 Blog Post</h2>
            <h3>
                Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
            </h3>
            <p>
                For the most part the first week is what I expected. Going through relatively basic concepts on github seems
                to be a natural first step towards the end goal of being a developer. However experiencing as much of a struggle
                o learn these concepts is a refreshing experience that I have not had for some time.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What are you struggling with?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The main struggle was understanding how to get this blog post to work as I was a bit lost in the beginning as far as where
                to put this text and how to set up folders on github using git. Other than this command line has been a bit of a struggle
                to learn properly. That or maybe it is just experiencing the learning curve.
            </p>
                <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
            <p>
                I'm very eager to begin coding and becoming familiar with our future work. This is the same feeling I have as when you 
                start a new job and have that lost feeling trying to learn the area. It's a daunting feeling but I cannot wait to overcome it
                since it is such a satisfying feeling to do.
