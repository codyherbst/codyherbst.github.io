However I want to further this by summarizing multiples of the same article across different sites to try and distill the most reliable and up-to-date summary.",

There is also Google's <a href='https://cloud.google.com/natural-language'>API</a> that is possible to use. However, my understanding is that Stanford's NLP can be set up on the same webserver likely making it more efficient than accessing Google's API, especially if the website parses multiple articles at a time.",
