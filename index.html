            <h2>Week One Blog Post</h2>
            <p>
                Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
            </p>
            <p>
                For the most part the first week is what I expected. Going through relatively basic concepts on github seems
                to be a natural first step towards the end goal of being a developer. However experiencing as much of a struggle
                o learn these concepts is a refreshing experience that I have not had for some time.
            </p>

                What are you struggling with?
            </p>
            <p>
                The main struggle was understanding how to get this blog post to work as I was a bit lost in the beginning as far as where
                to put this text and how to set up folders on github using git. Other than this command line has been a bit of a struggle
                to learn properly. That or maybe it is just experiencing the learning curve.
            </p>
                What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
            <p>
                I'm very eager to begin coding and becoming familiar with our future work. This is the same feeling I have as when you 
                start a new job and have that lost feeling trying to learn the area. It's a daunting feeling but I cannot wait to overcome it
                since it is such a satisfying feeling to do.
